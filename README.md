WELCOME TO AMFEED
AMFeed is the fastest blockchain in the world that has real external utility, several times the speed of any other comparable chain. AMFeed is also the only provider of live crypto trading data in the form of streaming 3D price-volume charts. Our exchange promises to boast some of the largest bitcoin holders in the world acting as market makers.

AmFeed: Mission
AMFeed stands for All Markets Feed, and our aim is to provide the most intuitive, transparent market data for every asset in the world. AMFeed began as an experiment to better-represent Bitcoin price data, and especially, to highlight voluminous wash trading in digital asset markets. After opening up a test run in alpha, AMFeed's Bitcoin charts quickly became one of the most popular features in among crypto traders.


AMFeed has developed an X11 Blockchain to further its goals of providing visually captivating, tradeable data for investors of all markets. By utilising the Blockchain, AMFeed will be able to price all API data quotes in Feed, the Blockchain's minimum unit of account (the same as a Satoshi is to Bitcoin). Further, due to Masternode staking, AMFeed will be able to price its API quotes not via a centralised manner but in the form of decentralised voting among coin miners.
